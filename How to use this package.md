+ Download from [here](https://github.com/YasuakiHonda/GaloisGroupSolver/archive/master.zip) and save it anywhere on your computer.
+ Extract files from master.zip .
+ Change directory to where files are stored.
+ Start your maxima in wxMaxima or console. (Here we assume you are using console maxima). In maxima,
+ load("SolveSolvable2.mac");
+ SolveSolvable(x^3-3*x+1)$

There are several example polynomials in SolveSolvable2.mac.
You may try step by step execution by using SSquintic.mac.

It may take very long time (10 - 20 hours) if you give an unsolvable quintic to SolveSolvable().

Enjoy!
